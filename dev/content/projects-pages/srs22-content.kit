        <p id="p1" class="proj-copy overview cursor-text">Our journey together in the Graphic Design program at Drexel
            has been
            like a maze. The first maze we encountered was navigating (and getting lost in) the URBN building. Then, we
            encountered the emotional maze of the design process. Despite the loop-de-loops and road blocks we
            encountered, we have persevered and are emerging from the maze as talented and passionate designers, a
            product of the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design.
        </p>
        <p class="proj-copy overview cursor-text">
            This year’s Senior Showcase focuses on
            the mental aspects of the design process and on our collective experience. We gained INSPIRATION from the
            work around us. We hit CREATIVE BLOCKS during those late nights. We helped give CRITIQUES to our peers who
            needed fresh eyes. Lastly, we pulled through the GRIND and produced our final projects. The maze represents
            this design journey, the beloved community we've cultivated, and our home for the last four years. And now,
            we are excited to share our home with you.
