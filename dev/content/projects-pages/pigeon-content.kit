                    trust and credibility in election content for readers. This project was created as an entry for The
                    New York Times x Adobe Creative Jam in September 2021. This was a fast-paced (one week)
                    collaborative project. Cheryl Vo and I worked together to create the brand guidelines,
                    illustrations, and mobile prototype for this product. </p>

                    environment. Within the deadline, we wanted to create a working prototype of this product by
                    combining our vision and research. It is important for both of us, as non-US citizens, to be precise
                    with our sources while researching US politics, and we wanted to create a platfrom that will allow
                    our users to easily do the same thing. </p>

        <p class="proj-copy overview cursor-text">Inspired by the carrier pigeon and the pigeons in New York City, we
            wanted to use the pigeon as our mascot. Key visuals include this pigeon doing daily tasks: reading the
            newspaper, discussing election topics with its peers, watching election news on TV, running to voting sites,
            etc. We wanted to keep the brand colorful and youthful in contrast to the usual minimalistic design choices
            in political publications.

        <h3 class="proj-copy-section-name overview-name cursor-text">product ideation & process —</h3>
        <p id="pigeon-research-p1" class="proj-copy overview cursor-text">Since the majority of US citizens get news
            from digital platforms, the need for credible sources of information is increasing. During election times,
            it is crucial that voters do not get their news from sites with media bias or false information. Therefore,
            we wanted to make sure that our product is used as a tool for users to find credible sources. UX research is
            extremely important in our process, as we need to provide oour users with an environment which they find
            reliable. We need our audience to know that we are not trying to sell them anything, or to force our beliefs
            onto them; we are simply an asset that they can use to make their own educated decision.
        </p>
        <p class="proj-copy overview cursor-text">
            Within our product, we wanted to implement a badges system indicating credible, verified authors and
            sources. Article authors have “verified” and “credible” badges that link users to their credentials and
            related articles. Articles have “verified” and “peer-reviewed” badges that link users to their cited sources
            and respective authors. Beside their function, these badges also provide the mobile product with a more
            relaxing environment for users to feel safe and comfortable.
