                    with a caret cursor after the brand logo mark to separate the overall brand with the individual
                    applications. With IBM Plex Mono and Poppins being the 2 main typefaces and the youthful, energetic
                    color palette, “long story short” wants to relate to its audience, making sure to let them know that
                    the brand identifies with them, and that their stories are told in the way they want them to be.

            filled with the same questions: “how are you? how was 2020? are you doing okay?” This repitition of these
            pleasantries reflects the start of 2021: everybody was asking and being asked these questions. The thought
            process went on, where the writer asks themselves if they are napping, if the readers are napping, and
            whether the stars above them are also napping; or is everything that happened all real. To end this chapter,
            the writer emphasizes that if the whole universe is napping, when everyone wakes up, they hope that we will
            no longer be alone.

        <p class="proj-copy overview cursor-text">“Can’t We Just Leave The Monster Alive?” uses the imaginary figure
            from a lot of people’s childhood: the monster under the bed. Through this motif, this chapter explores how
            anxiety, imagination and fears affect a young adult’s psychological and emotional response to isolation
            during the pandemic. This zine has a black background, and starts out with the “dear you” greeting type
            treated in a distorted way. This indicates the lack of clarity and the presence of fear in the young adult
            when they are talking about the monster. The zine then opens up into 2 open 5”x5” cubicles. These represent
            the rooms that the writer was stuck in when they were writing this letter. When time passes and the writer
            is revisited by the monster under the bed, they realize that it was the anxiety and fear of darkness when
            they were a child that made them afraid of the monster, and the monster itself wasn’t really scary. In this
            letter to their friend, the writer said that this monster “is just a scared little kid, just like you and
            me.” Upon this realization, the distored type treatment disappears, and the monster became a friend that
            stays alongside the writer when they were all alone. If the reader turns the zine upwards to “check under
            the bed,” they can see the little monster hiding in there, and a note from the writer saying “thank you for
            being my friend.”

            half of 2021, and how the fear of missing out (FOMO) has affected young adults while they were staying
            inside. This booklet is bound together by the Japanese stab binding method, and is more photographic in its
            treatment. It is a train of thoughts inside the writer’s head, a lot of walking back to the places they went
            to before lockdown started, how every day feels like an endless winter, and how they have lost a summer.
            This booklet uses transparent papers in some pages in order to show the thoughts in the writer’s head while
            they are at that specific location. The cut-out page shows the uncertainty of the writer and how they want
            the time the have lost be returned to them.

        <p class="proj-copy overview cursor-text">“Fairy of Shampoo” is lyrical and poetic chapter, which reminisces
            about the beauty of a shampoo advertisement model in the '80s. Through this motif, this chapter talks about
            mainstream media and its impact on young adults during the time where they are consuming more content than
            ever before. This chapter uses graphic collage elements that relate to the perception of what media is.
            With the front cover being a familiar music screen and opening up into the TV, phones, eyes, and a lot of
            repeating copy, “Fairy of Shampoo” highlights the repetitive nature of mainstream media. Everything is
            repeated, but each time, we still consume this content. This zine also opens up into a poster that readers
            can hang up in their room or keep as a collectible.
