                <p class="overview cursor-text">Man Ray (born Emmanuel Radnitzky, 1890-1976) was an American visual artist who spent
                    most of his career in Paris. He was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements.
                    He was best known for his pioneering photography, and he was a renowned fashion and portrait
                    photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with photograms, which he called “rayographs” in
                    reference to himself. “Man Ray: Prophet of the Avant-garde” is an artist catalogue on Ray’s works as
                    an artist, and his influence on the Dada and Surrealist art movements. </p>

                <p class="goals cursor-text">Fully hand-made from design to production, this book takes its readers through
                    insights and artistic information about Man Ray, while also keeping them engaged with experimental
                    typography integrating with Ray’s iconic rayographs. With a larger book format (13.5”x12”) and the
                    sophisticated Japanese stab-binding method, this artist catalogue strives to be an essential piece
                    in its audience’s collection of coffee table art books. </p>
